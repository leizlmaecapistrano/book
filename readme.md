In   the   world   of   programming, abstraction   allows   us   to   encapsulate   shared characteristics while enabling unique behavior among different classes. This code achieved by marking the attributes _title, _author, and _genre as protected, denoted by the underscore prefix. This means they are intended to be accessed only within the class or its subclasses. Getter methods are provided to access these attributes, encapsulating their access. It also demonstrated through method overriding. Each subclass provides its own implementation of the display_info() method, which is defined as abstract in the base class Book. Despite the method having the same name in each subclass, they behave differently based on the specific type of book, showcasing polymorphic behavior.  Instances of different book types (e.g., ClassicBook, FantasyBook) are created and stored in a list named books. Then, polymorphism is utilized to call the display_info() method on each book object, which displays information specific to the genre of that book.
